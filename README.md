# Lillium-chain

Lillium's blockchain:  
More fang-tastic than secure, but guaranteed to be a crypt-ic good time.
---
Ah, the Lillium-chain, a blockchain so revolutionary, it'll have even the most crypt-dwelling skeptic raising an eyebrow (or should we say, cobweb?). This project, not exactly the brainchild of the eternally youthful Lillium (bless her batty heart), is more of a well-meaning, yet slightly fang-tastic, attempt to enter the digital age.

Imagine, a system built on the unyielding principles of... well, whatever Lillium scribbled on a napkin after a particularly enthusiastic blood-tasting. Think of it as a blockchain held together with duct tape and vampire charm. Sure, it might not be the most secure network on the market, but at least it'll keep you entertained for hours trying to decipher Lillium's cryptic coding notes, scrawled in what appears to be bat guano and regret.

This isn't a project endorsed by Lillium herself, mind you.  She's more interested in perfecting her eternal youth routine than the intricacies of cryptography. But hey, someone's gotta keep the undead (and frankly, the living) entertained, right?

So download the Lillium-chain, if you have a taste for the... unconventional. Just remember, with great blockchain aspirations comes great responsibility, and the responsibility here is to not blame the developers when your transactions get mysteriously stuck in "eternal processing," much like Lillium seems to be stuck in a state of perpetual adolescence.

## ToDo List

- [ ] learn GO
- [ ] Make a blockchain
  - [ ] Define structs for Block and Transaction with relevant data fields.
  - [ ] Implement BLAKE2b hashing for block data.
  - [ ] Implement a Node struct to manage libp2p functionalities
  - [ ] Create a libp2p host.
  - [ ] Implement peer discovery (e.g., using libp2p's mdns or dht protocols).
  - [ ] Define message handling functions for received transactions or blocks (consider using protocols like IPLD for data structures).
  - [ ] Simulate or design a mechanism to generate and submit transactions (e.g., from a user interface).
  - [ ] Implement logic to validate transactions before adding them to a block.
  - [ ] Implement methods to add new blocks to the chain (considering a simplified approach without complex consensus mechanisms).
  - [ ] Explore options for persisting the blockchain data (e.g., in-memory for now, or consider a database for future enhancements).
  - [ ] Develop logic for nodes to broadcast new blocks or transactions to other nodes in the network using libp2p protocols.
  - [ ] Implement logic for nodes to receive and validate incoming blocks or transactions.
  - [ ] Write unit tests for core functionalities (e.g., block hashing, transaction validation).
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit
